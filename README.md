# go-chatbot-lab

Development only. I'm trying to learnsome golang! First project, building a chatbot!

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/go-chatbot-lab
```

### Testing

``make test``
